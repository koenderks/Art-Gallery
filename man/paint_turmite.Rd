\description{
This function paints a turmite. A turmite is a Turing machine which has an orientation in addition to a current state and a "tape" that consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells. The algorithm is simple: 1) turn on the spot (left, right, up, down) 2) change the color of the square 3) move forward one square.
